I'm a Full Stack developer, looking for opportunites to continue challenging myself, building applications that will challenge the current technologies and benefit consumers.

Following a 5-year client-facing career in the healthcare sector, I wanted to do a job that I not only enjoyed but would make a difference. Inspired by the recent focus on technology in the healthcare sector, in early 2020 I found what I had been looking for in software development. 

I have recently graduated from [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/) (London's leading programming bootcamp), learning best practice, tools and methodologies.

## Skills

### Client Relationship Management & Project Management

A career of working with internal and external clients to understand, execute and deliver client expectations and managing stakeholder engagement through the project lifecycle.

### Communication

Coming from a complex industry in Orthopadics, I am well equipt when communicating with non-technical stakeholders, translating technical details into clear leyman terms. I have a strong experience of using this skill to get buy-in from executive stakeholders into a number of projects and products.

### Effective Teamwork

Throughout my time at Makers, I often took it upon myself to educate myself on new technologies needed for projects and feedback my learnings to my peers.

 One example was the introduction of Redux to manage state with a React app. I spent an evening learning Redux and then relayed that learning to the group the next morning, which they then used to quickly and effectively use Redux reducers to manipulate state and rerender our application.

 ### Technical Knowledge

I have worked with a variety of languages, technologies and softwares.
